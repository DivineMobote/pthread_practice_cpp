# pthread_practice_cpp

This repository contains practice examples in C++ using POSIX threads (pthreads), developed as part of ITSC 3146 – Operating Systems and Computer Networking at UNC Charlotte. These examples demonstrate key concepts in concurrent programming, synchronization, and thread coordination.

##  Contents

- **[assignment-5-2-peterson-mutex](assignment-5-2-peterson-mutex/)**  
  - Implements Peterson’s Solution for mutual exclusion without hardware-level atomic instructions
  - Shows usage of mutex locks for thread-safe operations

- **[assignment-6-1-condition-variables](assignment-6-1-condition-variables/)**  
  - Demonstrates the Producer-Consumer problem
  - Uses pthread condition variables and mutexes for thread synchronization
